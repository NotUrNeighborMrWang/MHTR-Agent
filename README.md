# ðŸ¤– MHTR-Agent: A Novel Paradigm for Heat Treatment Research Based on Multimodal Analysis and LLMs

## Project Overview

MHTR-Agent is an innovative multimodal AI framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with data mining, machine learning, and multimodal analysis for materials science research. The framework aims to address challenges in the carburizing heat treatment process, enabling precise prediction of material properties and optimization of heat treatment parameters.

This project aims to promote collaboration between AI technologies and materials scientists by automating the analysis of the "compositionâ€“microstructureâ€“performance" relationship and providing advanced tools for optimizing carburizing processes.

> The workflow for the MHTR-Agent includes the following components: "Scripting Tools and Database" for database construction, "Trend Tracker" for tracking development trends and frontier hotspots, "Performance Predictor" for predicting material microstructure and performance, and a multimodal intelligent advisor, "MHT-Advisor," built by integrating public and proprietary databases.

## Features

- **Multimodal Data Analysis**: Integrates text, tabular, and image data for high-precision material property prediction.
- **Performance Predictor**: Uses FLAVA vision-language models and neural networks to reduce the mean absolute error (MAE) of hardness prediction to 2.87 HV.
- **Trend Tracker**: Extracts and visualizes research trends and hotspots in heat treatment.
- **MHT-Advisor**: An intelligent assistant based on Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) technology, providing actionable advice and optimizing carburizing process parameters.
