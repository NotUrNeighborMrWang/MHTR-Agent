Microstructure and mechanical properties were analyzed using XRD, SEM, EBSD, hardness testing, and friction tests.",

                "microstructure": "A TaC/Ta2C bilayer was observed. With increasing carburizing time, grain size and layer thickness increased. The outer layer of TaC showed non-stoichiometric characteristics, with higher lattice distortion due to carbon.",
                "mechanical_properties": "The hardness increased with carburizing time, from 104.1 HV to 322.5 HV. Adhesion strength peaked at 8 hours (49.1 N) but decreased at 12 hours due to layer thickness. Wear resistance improved with carburizing, stabilizing friction coefficients.",
